When you pause a YouTube video, the player controls don't disappear. That makes it really hard to take a clean screenshot of the video. The controls also block your view, which can get really annoying.

Hyde is a simple Chrome extension that allows you to hide or show the video player controls easily. Simply use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+M to hide the controls or show them again.
