Scroll Stay is a Chrome extension designed to maintain the page scroll position during window resizing. This feature aims to address the issue in i3wm where you may be reading a tutorial and have a terminal open. When the browser size changes, the content you were viewing may shift unexpectedly due to the static scroll top. Scroll Stay prevents such disruptions by preserving the scroll position.
